# BTC and Gold Price Relationship Analysis in R

This project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold prices using advanced time series tools in R. By leveraging techniques such as Engle-Granger causality tests and cointegration tests, we seek to uncover potential long-term relationships and dependencies between these two assets.

## Project Overview
- Perform data collection and preprocessing: Obtain historical price data for BTC and gold from reliable sources, clean the data, and ensure consistency.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis: Visualize the price trends and statistical characteristics of BTC and gold to gain insights into their behavior.
- Perform Engle-Granger causality test: Determine if there is a causal relationship between BTC and gold prices, exploring whether one asset's price movements predict or influence the other.
- Conduct cointegration analysis: Investigate the presence of a long-term relationship between BTC and gold, examining whether their prices move together over time.
- Implement other relevant time series analyses: Utilize additional advanced techniques such as ARIMA modeling, Granger causality tests, or Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, as appropriate.
- Interpret and present findings: Analyze the results obtained from the analyses and provide meaningful insights into the relationship between BTC and gold prices.
